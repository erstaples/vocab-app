# Ideas

## Freeform learning mode

* Freeform learning mode prompts a user to write a sentence with a learned or reviewed word. 
* The system will send their entry to an LLM (either integrated or BYOK) for evaluation. 

## BYOK (Bring-your-own-key)

* Allow users to add an LLM service API key in order to use the various LLM-related tools.

## BYOW (Bring-your-own-words)

* Allow users to customize their word list by importing a word list. The list could include definitions etc, or users can simply pass in a list of words and let the LLM populate the rest.

## Morphemes / Root Exploration

* Improve understanding, recall, and memorization by deconstructing the word down into its component morphemes
* Prefix + suffix analysis
* Synonym comparison
* Visual etymology tree
* Contextual application
* Memory association exercises
