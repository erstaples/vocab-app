## Current Architecture Analysis

The vocabulary app is currently in a transitional state with some functionality moved to a backend Express server, but significant business logic and database access still happens in the frontend. This creates several issues:

        UI[UI Components]
        WS[Word Service]
        UPS[User Progress Service]

    end

        PG[(PostgreSQL)]
        
        Express --> PG
        API --> Express
    end
```

**Key Issues Identified:**

1. **Security concerns**: Direct database access from frontend is a security risk
2. **Inconsistent data persistence**: Dual storage methods (localStorage and PostgreSQL)
3. **Performance issues**: Heavy logic running in the browser
4. **Unnecessary polyfills**: Node.js modules being emulated in browser
5. **Architectural inconsistency**: Mixed responsibilities between frontend and backend

## Proposed Architecture

The proposed architecture clearly separates concerns between frontend and backend:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Frontend
        UI[UI Components]
        FEWS[Word Service Client]
        FEUPS[User Progress Service Client]
        FESRS[Spaced Repetition Service Client]
        FEGS[Gamification Service Client]
        FEAPI[API Client]
        
        UI --> FEWS
        UI --> FEUPS
        UI --> FESRS
        UI --> FEGS
        FEWS --> FEAPI
        FEUPS --> FEAPI
        FESRS --> FEAPI
        FEGS --> FEAPI
    end
    
    subgraph Backend
        API[API Layer]
        BEWS[Word Service]
        BEUPS[User Progress Service] 
        BESRS[Spaced Repetition Service]
        BEGS[Gamification Service]
        PG[(PostgreSQL)]
        
        API --> BEWS
        API --> BEUPS
        API --> BESRS
        API --> BEGS
        
        BEWS --> PG
        BEUPS --> PG
        BESRS --> PG
        BEGS --> PG
        
        FEAPI --> API
    end
```

**Key Principles:**

1. Frontend should only handle UI and user interactions
2. Backend should handle all business logic and data persistence
3. Clear service boundaries with well-defined interfaces
4. Single source of truth for data in PostgreSQL
5. Secure API-based communication between layers

## Service Migration Plan

### 1. Word Service

**Current state:** 
- Uses static dataset in frontend
- Contains word retrieval, search, and relationship logic

**Target state:**
- Move entire service to backend
- Create API endpoints for all word operations
- Frontend should only request and display words

**Migration steps:**
1. Create backend Word Service in `server/services/word-service.js`
   - Implement CRUD operations for words
   - Add search and filtering functionality
   - Create endpoints for word relationships
2. Update frontend Word Service to use API client
3. Remove static dataset and direct manipulation from frontend

### 2. User Progress Service

**Current state:**
- Hybrid approach with both localStorage and PostgreSQL
- Contains user data management and persistence logic
- Interacts with other services (word, spaced repetition, gamification)

**Target state:**
- Move all persistence logic to backend
- Simplify frontend to only make API calls
- Remove localStorage fallback

**Migration steps:**
1. Complete backend User Progress Service in `server/services/user-progress-service.js`
2. Implement comprehensive API endpoints
3. Simplify frontend to remove conditional logic and localStorage fallback
4. Update frontend to use API client exclusively

### 3. Spaced Repetition Service

**Current state:**
- Implements SM-2 algorithm in frontend
- Manages review schedules and scoring

**Target state:**
- Move algorithm implementation to backend
- Create API endpoints for processing reviews
- Frontend only submits review data and displays results

**Migration steps:**
1. Create backend Spaced Repetition Service in `server/services/spaced-repetition-service.js`
2. Move SM-2 algorithm implementation
3. Create API endpoints for processing reviews
4. Update frontend to submit review data via API

### 4. Gamification Service

**Current state:**
- Manages badges, levels, streaks in frontend
- Contains complex business rules for gamification

**Target state:**
- Move all gamification logic to backend
- Create API endpoints for retrieving badges, levels, etc.
- Frontend only displays gamification elements

**Migration steps:**
1. Create backend Gamification Service in `server/services/gamification-service.js`
2. Move badge, level, and streak logic
3. Create API endpoints for retrieving gamification data
4. Update frontend to display gamification elements from API

## API Endpoint Structure

```

```

## Polyfill Removal Plan

| Polyfill | Current Use | Plan |
|----------|-------------|------|
| fs.ts | Empty implementation | Remove after moving file operations to backend |
| path.ts | Re-export of path-browserify | Remove after moving path operations to backend |
| path-browserify.d.ts | Type definitions | Remove with path.ts |
| empty.js | Placeholder for Node modules | Remove when Node.js dependencies are eliminated |

**Build Configuration Update:**

Current `config-overrides.js` includes numerous polyfills for Node.js modules. After migration:

1. Remove polyfills for:
   - fs, path, crypto, etc.
   - pg-native and database-related modules
   - bcrypt and authentication modules

2. Simplify webpack configuration:
   - Remove module replacements
   - Remove unnecessary aliases
   - Reduce plugin complexity

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Development (2-3 weeks)
- Create service structure in backend
- Implement API endpoints
- Ensure database integration

### Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring (2-3 weeks)
- Create API client wrappers
- Update services to use API
- Remove direct database access

### Phase 3: Polyfill Cleanup (1 week)

## Timeline and Resource Estimation

### Overall Project Timeline: 6-8 Weeks
