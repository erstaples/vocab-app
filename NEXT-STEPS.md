# Next Steps

I'm developing a TypeScript/React vocabulary learning application that gamifies learning literary words through spaced repetition. I've already implemented the basic structure, but I need help implementing several advanced features we've designed. My codebase currently includes:

* Core data models for words, users, and learning progress
* Basic spaced repetition algorithm based on SM-2
* Simple learning interfaces for flashcards and reviews
* User progress tracking and gamification elements

## New Features to Implement

### 1. Word Construction Lab

Implement a new learning mode that breaks down words into morphemes (roots, prefixes, suffixes), showing:

* Visual morpheme blocks with color-coding (prefix: blue, root: green, suffix: purple)
* Interactive meaning construction that shows how morphemes combine
* Etymology exploration with language origin information
* Word family networks showing related words
* Associated concepts that link to morpheme meanings

#### UI Guidelines

* Drag-and-drop interactive elements for word building
* Animated transitions between morpheme explanations
* Progressive disclosure of linguistic information

#### Database Guidelines

Database schema should be enhanced to include:

* Detailed morphemic analysis of words
* Relationship networks between words
* Etymology and language origin data
* Conceptual associations for morphemes

### 2. Advanced Learning Modes

Add these additional learning modes:

* Context Guess Mode: Fill-in-the-blank sentences with target word
* Word Connections Mode: Identifying semantically related words
* Sentence Formation Mode: Creating sentences with LLM evaluation
* Etymology Explorer: Interactive word origin visualization

### 3. LLM Integration for Sentence Evaluation

Implement an API-connected feature that:

* Prompts users to create sentences using target vocabulary
* Sends sentences to an LLM (OpenAI/Claude) for intelligent assessment
* Returns detailed feedback on usage quality with:

* Correctness score (0-100)
* Specific feedback on usage
* Alternative suggestions
* Example better usages

### 4. Comprehensive Learning Workflow

Structure the learning journey into phases:

* Introduction & Initial Comprehension (Day 1)
* Active Processing & Connections (Days 2-4)
* Consolidation & Refinement (Days 9-19)
* Mastery & Long-term Retention (Days 39+)

Each phase should involve different learning modes and increasing complexity.

### 5. Enhanced Database Schema

Implement a database structure supporting:

* Detailed morphemic analysis of words
* Relationship networks between words
* Etymology and language origin data
* Conceptual associations for morphemes
* User learning progress at word and morpheme levels
* Spaced repetition algorithm data
* Gamification elements (XP, badges, achievements)

### 6. Memory Hook System

Create a feature allowing users to:

* Select or create personalized memory hooks for words
* Choose between different memory techniques (visualization, wordplay, etc.)
* Save and rate effectiveness of memory techniques
* Share memory hooks with other users

### 7. Mobile-First UI Design

Implement a responsive, intuitive UI with:

* Card-based layouts for content blocks
* Consistent color-coding for morpheme types
* Progressive disclosure of complex information
* Thumb-friendly interaction zones
* Micro-interactions and animations for engagement
* Tab-based organization of content types

## Implementation Guidelines

* Follow TypeScript best practices with proper interfaces and types
* Use React hooks for state management
* Implement responsive design for all components
* Use consistent naming conventions
* Add comprehensive documentation
* Include unit tests for core functionality
* Optimize for performance with proper memoization
* Design for extensibility and future feature additions
