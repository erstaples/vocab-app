# Vocabulary App Architecture Reorganization

## What Has Been Accomplished

We've successfully reorganized the backend architecture of the Vocabulary App according to the plan:

1. **Backend Services**:
   - ✅ Database Service: Centralized database access
   - ✅ Word Service: Vocabulary management
   - ✅ Spaced Repetition Service: Learning algorithm implementation
   - ✅ Gamification Service: Badges, levels, streak management
   - ✅ User Service: User data and preferences
   - ✅ Migrations Service: Database schema management

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - ✅ Words API: Word CRUD operations
   - ✅ Reviews API: Spaced repetition functionality
   - ✅ Gamification API: Badges and stats
   - ✅ Users API: User management

3. **Utility Scripts**:
   - ✅ Data migration script: Transfers static data to database

4. **Documentation**:
   - ✅ Backend README
   - ✅ Architecture plan

## Next Steps for Frontend Refactoring

The backend is now ready, but we need to refactor the frontend to use the new backend services exclusively. Here's what needs to be done:

### 1. Frontend Service Refactoring

#### Word Service (`src/services/word-service/index.ts`)
- [ ] Remove the static word dataset
- [ ] Replace all direct operations with API calls
- [ ] Ensure all methods return data in the same format expected by components

#### User Progress Service (`src/services/user-progress-service/index.ts`)
- [ ] Remove all localStorage logic
- [ ] Remove the USE_POSTGRES conditional paths
- [ ] Ensure all methods use the API service

#### Spaced Repetition Service (`src/services/spaced-repitition/index.ts`)
- [ ] Move algorithm implementation to a utility folder (if needed for fallback)
- [ ] Update methods to use the API for all data operations
- [ ] Keep core logic only for UI-related operations

#### Gamification Service (`src/services/gamification-service/index.ts`)
- [ ] Replace direct data manipulation with API calls
- [ ] Move business rules to backend-only
- [ ] Keep only UI-related operations in frontend

### 2. Polyfill Removal

After the services are refactored to use the backend exclusively:

- [ ] Remove `src/polyfills/fs.ts`
- [ ] Remove `src/polyfills/path.ts`
- [ ] Remove `src/polyfills/path-browserify.d.ts`
- [ ] Update `src/polyfills/empty.js` references

### 3. Build Configuration Updates

- [ ] Update `config-overrides.js` to remove unnecessary polyfills
- [ ] Remove Node.js module replacements:
  - [ ] fs
  - [ ] path
  - [ ] pg-native
  - [ ] other database-related modules

### 4. Testing

- [ ] Test all frontend functionality with backend integration
- [ ] Verify data persistence
- [ ] Ensure all UI components work as expected

## How to Get Started

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Run the data migration script:
   ```
   cd server
   npm run import-words
   ```

3. Create a demo user through the API:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/demo-user
   ```

4. Test the backend API endpoints with tools like Postman or curl
   
5. Begin frontend refactoring according to the steps above

## Benefits of the New Architecture

- **Better Security**: Direct database access moved to backend
- **Improved Performance**: Heavy computation on server-side
- **Consistent Data**: Single source of truth in PostgreSQL
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Smaller Bundle Size**: Removal of Node.js polyfills
- **Better Maintainability**: Backend can evolve independently
